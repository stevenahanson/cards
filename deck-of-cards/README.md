# Snap Card Game

This is a simple single-page card game built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, using the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/).

Players draw cards from a shuffled deck. If the **value** or **suit** of the newly drawn card matches the previous card, a **SNAP!** message appears. The game ends when all 52 cards are drawn, showing the total matches.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000
with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
